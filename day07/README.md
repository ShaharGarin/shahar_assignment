A program to save protein sequence files from ncbi.

Will search and download up to 10,000 fasta files (a limit made by ncbi). The program must be run through the command line, with a search term (string) and the number of files you wish to download (an integer).
The name of each file will be printed.
A log file (csv) will be created, logging the date, time, search value, number of files saved and the total results from the search quarry.
